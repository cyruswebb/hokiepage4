<h2>British Literary History</h2>

	<p>For British Literary History we explored the history of English literature from the medevial ages to the modern ages. We first read orally based transcribed works and then worked our way up to more modernist literature. The class more or less acted as a synopsis of the greatest hits of English Literature.</p>

<h2>Women and Literature</h2>
		<p>In this particular class we read six or seven works written by females authors, focusing on the theme of women and madness. For each selection we would examine how that particular work related to the previous works we examined while looking at how each work approached the theme of women and madness.</p>

<h2>World Regions</h2>
		<p>World Regions was a pretty unique class, as it was based on a total point system rather than the traditional grading scale. I took this class online, and it mainly consisted of watching several videos about world history and current events and then taking an online quiz on those particular videos.</p>

<h2>Critical Writing</h2>
        <p>For this particular course we analyzed several works of literature and also learned how to write a variety of different types of papers. The class was very writing intensive, and was concluded with a large research paper on a topic of our choosing.</p>
            
<h2>Introductory Sociology</h2>
        <p>The Introductory Sociology course that I took went over the basics of a wide range of sociological topics. I really enjoyed this class and am thinking of minoring in sociology if I can fit the classes into my schedule.</p>
